!!! Please make sure 'words' folder is in the same directory as .exe - 
    all the words used in game are in this folder. You can edit files (add more words) 
    but dont rename them :)

C# WinForms code-behind

Now, this is a very special app for me. What is it? It is a program that helps you play 
a popular game called password: if you have seen any of the password game shows, you'd know 
that people make up teams and guess words based on a "key" aka password given to them. So this 
app has a couple of hundreds of words and an interface that will help you play the game (you can see words
and timer and words used as well).

So what's so special? It's not even WPF! Simple code behind!

Exactly. I did it within 10 hours to actually use for a game. Since I had not much time, the 
goal was: make the code flat and make it work. I never changed it since. Just keep it as it is.
So as an example of a working thing that was done so quickly I think it's pretty amazing :)
